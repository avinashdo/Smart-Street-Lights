Type Of Project : IOT


components used 

     1. Arduino uno board
     
     2. IR sensors
     
     3. Bread board
     
     4. LED lights
     
problem:

     when street lights are continously in the ON state it wastes a lot of power , so this project helps in reducing the wastage of electricity by implementing in low people density areas and times with low people density.
     
Working Process:

       whenever an object comes infront of the Street light it is detected by the IR sensors and it sends the signals to the Arduino board . Then the Arduino board allows power to the street lights and it will glow onlly then.
